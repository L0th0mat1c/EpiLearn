### Merge request and review

If you followed all the requirements above, the easier to read and review your merge requests (MR) will be therefore the faster they will be werged.

Once you consider your branch ready to be merged, create a new MR and assign your lead for a review.

If your MR does not meet the requirements above, they will not be merged and comments will be added for you to fix the line/file concerned. The easiest way to fix the issue is to checkout the concerned branch, commit your fix and push.
